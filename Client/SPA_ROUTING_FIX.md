# Frontend Deployment Guide

## SPA Routing Issue Fixed

The "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 () : live-classes" error has been fixed by adding proper SPA routing configuration.

## Files Added:

### 1. `vercel.json` - For Vercel deployment
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. `public/_redirects` - For Netlify deployment
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

### 3. `netlify.toml` - Alternative Netlify configuration
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

## What This Fixes:

- **Direct URL Access**: Users can now directly access `/live-classes` without getting 404 errors
- **Page Refresh**: Refreshing the page on any route will work correctly
- **Bookmarking**: Users can bookmark any page and it will load correctly
- **Browser Back/Forward**: Navigation will work properly

## Deployment Steps:

### For Vercel:
1. The `vercel.json` file will automatically be detected
2. Redeploy your frontend
3. Test by going directly to `/live-classes` and refreshing

### For Netlify:
1. The `_redirects` file will automatically be detected
2. Redeploy your frontend
3. Test by going directly to `/live-classes` and refreshing

### For Other Platforms:
- **Railway**: Add a `railway.toml` file with similar redirect rules
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Configure redirects in the platform settings
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Configure error pages to redirect to index.html

## Testing:

After deployment, test these scenarios:
1. Go directly to `https://your-domain.com/live-classes`
2. Refresh the page while on `/live-classes`
3. Use browser back/forward buttons
4. Bookmark `/live-classes` and access it later

All should work without 404 errors.

## Additional Notes:

- The `vite.config.ts` has been updated with better build optimization
- Chunk splitting is configured for better performance
- Source maps are disabled for production builds
- Server configuration is optimized for development
